    "\n",
    "In the real world, most random variables we observe are dependent on other random variables. For example, the probability of a person contracting an infectious disease is dependent on a number of other random variables. These random variables might include degree of exposure to other people with the infection, precautions taken, genetic disposition to contracting the disease, etc. As a result, to model and understand the probability of contracting the infectious disease, we must include other random variables in our model on which the probability of infection depends. In more technical terms, the probability of contracting the disease is **conditional** on other random variables.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As the foregoing example indicates, statistical models of complex processes invariably require the use of **conditional probability distributions**. In this assignment we will review the key properties of conditional probability distributions we will use in the remainder of this course.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional probability** is the probability that event A occurs given that event B has occurred. We can write conditional probability as follows, which we say is the probability of A given B:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B)$$\n",

    "Start by examining Figure 1, which shows a number of discrete events. The overall **sample space** is the space of all possible events in the set $S$. This space is divided into several **subspaces** or **subsets**, $A$, $B$ and $C$. The subsets $A$ and $B$ are shown as circles, with an **intersection** where the two sets overlap. Events in this intersection occur in both $A$ and $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can work out the conditional probability for the intersection between $A$ and $B$ as follows. First, we find the relationship between conditional probability and the intersection between the sets, $P(A \\cap B)$. To find this probability notice that it is the product of two probabilities:  \n",
    "1. $P(B)$ since B must be true to be in this intersection. \n",
    "2. $P(A|B)$ since A must also occur when B is occurring. Given this logic, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging terms we get the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(A|B) &= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{\\frac{2}{10}}{\\frac{4}{10}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have, just as well, written the last equation as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B \\cap A) = P(B|A)P(A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the probability of an identical event in the same intersection must be the same. Therefore we can write:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) = P(B \\cap A)$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conditional distributions and Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes' theorem**, also known as **Bayes' rule**, is a powerful tool to think about and analyze conditional probabilities. We will use the Bayes theorem in many subsequent parts of this book.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive Bayes Theorem starting with the following relationships: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$$\n",
    "$$P(B \\cap A) = P(B|A)P(A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\cap A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(A|B)P(B) &= P(B|A)P(A)\\\\\n",
    "P(A|B) &= \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is Bayes' theorem! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Bayes Theorm\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we interpret Bayes' theorem in a useful way? Consider the example where we wish to use Bayes Theorem to test a hypothesis given some data or **evidence**. We must make an assertion of our prior probability that the hypothesis is true, $prior(hypothesis)$. We also must choose a likelihood function of the evidence given the hypothesis, $Likelihood(evidence\\ |\\ hypothesis)$. Now, we can think of Bayes' theorem in the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Posterior(hypotheis\\ |\\ evidence) = \\frac{Likelihood(evidence\\ |\\ hypothesis)\\ prior(hypothesis)}{P(evidence)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the selection of prior probability distributions and likelihood functions in great detail in subsequent lectures. For now, we will just assume these are known. \n",
    "\n",
    "A difficult issue here is to come to grips with the denominator, $P(evidence)$. This term is often referred to as the **partition function**, a somewhat confusing reference to statistical mechanics in physics. The denominator is required to normalize the posterior distribution so it is in the range $0 \\le Posterior(hypotheis\\ |\\ evidence) \\le 1$ To properly normalize the posterior, the denominator must account for all possible outcomes, or alternative hypotheses, $h'$. This means that we can write Bayes Theorem as follows:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Posterior(hypotheis\\ |\\ evidence) = \\frac{Likelihood(evidence\\ |\\ hypothesis)\\ prior(hypothesis)}{\\sum_{ h' \\in\\ All\\ possible\\ hypotheses}Likelihood(evidence\\ |\\ h')\\ prior(h')}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like a formidable problem, and it is! It is often the case that computing this denominator by brute force is simply not feasible. We will address some ways to deal with this problem in subsequent lectures.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marginal Distributions   \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases of Bayesian analysis we are interested in the **marginal distribution**. For example, it is often the case that only one or a few parameters of a joint distribution will be of interest. In other words, we are interested in the marginal distribution of these parameters. Further, the denominator of Bayes theorem, $P(data)$, can sometimes be computed as a marginal distribution. For these reasons computing marginal distributions is an important aspect of Bayesian analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a multivariate probability density function with $n$ variables, $p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n)$. A **marginal distribution** is the distribution of one variable with the others integrated out. In other words, if we integrate over all other variables $\\{ \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n \\}$ the result is the marginal distribution of the variable of interest, $p(\\theta_1)$. We can express this idea mathematically as follows:       \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\theta_1) = \\int_{\\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n} p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n)\\ d\\theta2, \\ldots, d \\theta_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the marginal distribution for a discrete distribution by using a summation over the other variables, rather than integration:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\theta_1) = \\sum_{\\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n} p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example, marginal distributions of eye and hair color\n",

    "As an example, the [case of Sally Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Clarke) is now notorious in the annals of British justice. She was convicted in 1999 of murdering her two young sons. In part, she was convicted based on testimony of Professor Sir Roy Meadow who stated in court that the probability of two such deaths is 1 in 73 million. This analysis was based on an assumption that these death were random independent events. Meadow assumed that the probability of this outcome could be computed as two iid Bernoulli trials, each with $p=1/8500$, with the 'positive' outcome being a child dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). If Meadow's assumptions had been correct, the probability of two such independent deaths is just the square of the probability of a single death.    \n",
    "\n",
    "But, Meadow did not disclose or consider that the second child to die was found to have a serious bacteriological infection. On a second appeal, this fact was revealed. A correct analysis would have taken into account the conditional probability of the two deaths given the second child's susceptibility to the infection. Taking account of conditional distributions shows that given these circumstances the probability of both deaths being from natural causes is reasonably high. Further, given this additional condition the Bernoulli distributions of the two childern dying are no iid.     \n",

    "The long-running television game show, [*Let's Make A Deal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal), originally created and hosted by *Monte Hall*, had its hay-day in the 1970s. At the finale of the show, Monte would tell the winning contestant that they could pick one of three doors. Behind one door there would be a valuable prize like a car. Worthless items, like a goat, were placed behind the other two doors. The contestant would pick a door. At this point Monte would build suspense by opening one of the other doors. Monte knew which door had the valuable prize, and would always reveal one of the worthless prizes. He would then tell the contestant that they could change their choice of doors. The question is, should the contestant switch or stick with their original choice? Figure 4. illustrates the situation the contestant faces if they pick Door 1:\n",

    "The [Monte Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) has a long and convoluted history. In 1975, Steve Selvin published a letter in the *American Statistician* posing the problem of which strategy is optimal. The resulting debate created considerable controversy. This debate was put at full boil when [Marilyn vos Savant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant) wrote in her *Ask Marilyn* column in *Parade* magazine that the contestant should definitely switch. She was then ridiculed by several statisticians. But, was ultimately proven to be correct.\n",

Use this function to randomly select the door the car is behind and the contestant's initial choice of doors.    \n",

Create a function `win_prize`, which determines if the contestant wins the car, conditional on the strategy selected, $\\{ switch, no_{switch} \\}$, the door the contestant selected and the door with the car.
